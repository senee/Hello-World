# Hello-World
This Repository is used for all work related to FreeCodeCamp Projects.  
I've started the FreeCodeCamp on August 15 2016 with the goal of completing the entire curriculum within 12 months.  
At the same time, I am learning Python and R.
The end goal is to dovetail my Finance, Research and Political experience into a new career.
